<p><strong>Get more out of this course by getting live help from other students and chatting with my DevOps community.</strong> </p><p><strong>With this course, you have access to two options: Slack and Discord.</strong> Read on, and <strong>join one or both communities:</strong></p><h4>Discord</h4><p>Discord used to be a gamer-focused chat app, with lots of fun features and integrations, but they have now broadened to support all open communities, and it's a modern IRC-like way to interact. <strong>It's my favorite chat system for open source communities.</strong></p><p><strong>Join my "Vital DevOps"&nbsp;Discord server and gain access to a special channel for this course: </strong><a href="https://discord.gg/AnP5pgM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>https://discord.gg/AnP5pgM</strong></a></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2020-11-23_22-09-22-b5c3a63422879952edbb1adc1fabbead.png"></figure><h4>Slack</h4><p>If you prefer Slack, it has over 35,000 students that have helped each other learn container tools. Slack is a fantastic private, persistent chat product that I use in so many of the communities I'm in and thought it would be a great way for extending this course and adding more value to your learning. It comes with clients for all desktop and mobile OS's and also works in the browser.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-11-27_22-03-41-7422363eb9c2e39a3e2524aba832f2fc.png"></figure><p><strong>Steps to Join My Slack&nbsp;Team:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.bretfisher.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chat.bretfisher.com</a> and give it your email address.</p></li><li><p>You will be sent an email from Slack, with an invite link inside it.</p></li><li><p>Click that link in the email.</p></li><li><p>Fill out the form to create your Slack account.</p></li><li><p>Use that Slack account to access&nbsp;<a href="https://dockermastery.slack.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dockermastery.slack.com</a></p></li></ol><p>(I&nbsp;know that's a lot of steps, but since Udemy doesn't give me your email address, I&nbsp;have no way to pre-create you an account on Slack, and Slack is an invite-only system... so the first step is a way for it to auto-generate an invite for you.&nbsp;:)</p><p>Sign up and join the Docker and Kubernetes DevOps community!</p><p><br></p>
