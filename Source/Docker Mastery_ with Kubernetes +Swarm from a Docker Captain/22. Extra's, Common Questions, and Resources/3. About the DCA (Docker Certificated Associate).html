<p>I&nbsp;was a beta test taker for the DCA Exam in the fall of 2017, and got a 93%. Although this Docker Mastery&nbsp;course isn't designed around the DCA, it will cover at least 50%&nbsp;of the material you need to know for taking the exam. Remember the DCA&nbsp;is designed for their Docker EE&nbsp;paid product, which I don't teach in this course.
