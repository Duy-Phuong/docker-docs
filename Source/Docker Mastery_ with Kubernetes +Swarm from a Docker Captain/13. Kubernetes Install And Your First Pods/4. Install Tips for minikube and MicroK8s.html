<h4>Here are some tips for using minikube or MicroK8s in this course:</h4><p><strong>Note that in March 2020, Kubernetes 1.18 came out, and </strong><code><strong>kubectl run</strong></code><strong> syntax and functionality changed. This course is designed for 1.14-1.17 which are the prevalent versions used in cloud hosters, Docker Desktop, and enterprise solutions. minikube and MicroK8s now default to 1.18 installs, so it's up to you if you want to force installing version 1.17 (which I would recommend for now)&nbsp;or skip some of the first lectures about </strong><code><strong>kubectl run</strong></code><strong> because they no longer create deployments/jobs/cronjobs/services, etc. They only create pods.</strong></p><h4>minikube</h4><ul><li><p>minikube defaults to installing the latest Kubernetes release, but you likely don't want that, since it's 6-12 months before many clouds and enterprise solutions update to recent versions. You can look up <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">versions on GitHub</a>, and install a specific version like this <code>minikube start --kubernetes-version='1.17.4'</code></p></li><li><p>Unlike Docker Desktop, which lets you use localhost for your Kubernetes services, minikube runs in VirtualBox (by default)&nbsp;and has its own IP. Find that with <code>minikube ip</code></p></li><li><p>Remember top stop minikube when you're not using it to save resources <code>minikube stop</code></p></li><li><p>Check the status of what is running in minikube with <code>minikube status</code></p></li></ul><h4>MicroK8s</h4><ul><li><p>MicroK8s defaults to installing the latest Kubernetes release, but you likely don't want that, since it's 6-12 months before many clouds and enterprise solutions update to recent versions.
