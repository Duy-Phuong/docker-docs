<p><strong>Starting in version 1.18 (released March 2020), the </strong><code><strong>kubectl run</strong></code><strong> command only does one thing: create single pods.</strong> There were many reasons for this, but the big ones were to reduce the complexity of how the <code>run</code> command worked and to move other resource creation to the <code>kubectl create</code> command. The idea is that <code>kubectl run</code> is now similar to <code>docker run</code>. It creates a single pod, where <code>docker run</code> creates a single container.</p><p>A majority of us won't be able to use 1.18 for months if not a year or longer, many clouds and production Kubernetes products don't even support 1.17 (or 1.16)&nbsp;yet. I&nbsp;feel it's still important to know the old way that <code>run</code> has always worked, for at least the rest of 2020. </p><p>I've decided not to replace all the videos just yet, and to keep the "old" way of doing things intact, while giving you info on the differences in these text lectures.</p><p>Depending on which version of Kubernetes you have installed, you'll need to decide how you'll create objects. Here's a cheat sheet for how old commands should be used with the 1.18 changes.</p><p><code>kubectl <strong>run</strong> nginx --image nginx</code> created a Deployment named <code>nginx</code> <strong>before</strong> 1.18 (which creates a&nbsp;ReplicaSet, which creates a Pod)</p><p><code>kubectl <strong>run</strong> nginx --image nginx</code> creates a Pod named <code>nginx</code> <strong>in</strong> 1.18+</p><p>Creating a Deployment in 1.18:&nbsp;<code>kubectl <strong>create deployment</strong> nginx --image nginx</code></p><p><br></p>
