<p>Attached to this section is a ZIP file with the current state of my 'complex' multi-container project.  If you made any changes to your copy of the multi-container project, or if you didn't get it working, then download this zip file and use my copy.  </p><p>Its extremely important that your project files are identical to mine at this point - if anything is different then a lot of the Kubernetes stuff is going to appear to just not "work" for some mysterious reason.</p>
