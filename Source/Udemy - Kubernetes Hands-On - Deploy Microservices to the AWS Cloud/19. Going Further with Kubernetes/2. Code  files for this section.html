<p>Attached to this text lecture is a zip of some of the code (mainly yaml) used in this section. There's not much here, but it might be helpful if you want to avoid typing problems (and YAML indenting errors!). </p><p>You'll also be using some github repos, especially in the CI/CD section of the course.</p>
