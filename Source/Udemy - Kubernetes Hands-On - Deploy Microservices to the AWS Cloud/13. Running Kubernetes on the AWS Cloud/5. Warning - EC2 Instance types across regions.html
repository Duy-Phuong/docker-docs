<p>Just a quick additional note - not all instance types are supported in all regions, and kops unfortunately doesn't know about this!</p><p>For example, at the time of writing, the default instance type for the master node in kops is "c4.large". This is actually a slightly old instance type, which has now been superseded by c5.large.</p><p>That's ok in many regions as many of them will have both types -Â  but for example, if you're in eu-west-3 (Paris), then c4.large is not available - and this will mean your cluster won't start.</p><p>There's two solutions to this. You can either:</p><ol><li><p>Use region us-east-1. This region will probably have the instance types that kops is using by default. It's usually fast enough wherever in the world you actually are.</p></li><li><p>Change the instance types you're using. Run the command:</p><p><br></p><p><code>kops get instancegroups</code></p></li></ol><p>This will show the name of your master group (eg master-us-east-2c ). Now you can do:</p><p><code>kops edit ig &lt;name of master group&gt; </code></p><p>And you can change the instance type to one you can see in the pricing chart.</p><p>Then,</p><p><code>kops edit ig nodes</code></p><p>And do the same here.</p><p>Hopefully that will work - let me know if any problems.</p><p>Note: I used m3.medium to record the video - the default type is currently t2.medium.</p>
