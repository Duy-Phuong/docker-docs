<p>Warning!</p><p>When working in AWS, any resource you create WILL INCUR CHARGES.</p><p>These charges are billed by the hour. <strong>IF YOU FORGET TO DELETE THE RESOURCES, YOU WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED.</strong></p><p>We won't qualify for the free tier on this course. The resources for recording the entire course came to around 6USD, and I spent well over a week re-recording, editing etc. Your charges should be much lower.</p><p>However - <strong>IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DECIDE TO STOP THE COURSE, EVEN IF FOR A DAY OR SO, YOU MUST DELETE THE CLUSTER AS DESCRIBED IN THE VIDEO "DELETING THE CLUSTER".</strong></p><p><strong>Don't leave the cluster running overnight.</strong></p><p>It's very easy to re-create a cluster and there is a video explaining this.</p><p>I can't be held responsible for any oversights in your account. Please be careful!</p><p>I'll keep repeating this warning through the AWS sessions.</p><p>Your ever,</p><p>Richard Chesterwood.</p>
