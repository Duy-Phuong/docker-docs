<p>In this section, we're going to be deploying a lot more resources to your cluster.</p><p>I've realised since recording that on some systems, there won't be enough resources (RAM) in minikube to manage the full load. For some reason, I got away with it on the videos (although in a later section, when we use Mongo, I did have to expand the RAM).</p><p><strong>I recommend before starting this section that you set up minikube with plenty of RAM. To do this:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Stop minikube with "minikube stop"</p></li><li><p>Delete your existing minikube with "minikube delete"</p></li><li><p>Remove any config files with "rm ~/.kube" and "rm ~/.minikube". Or, delete these folders using your file explorer. The folders are stored in your home directory, which under windows will be "c:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;"</p></li><li><p>Now restart minikube with "minikube start --memory 4096".</p></li></ol><p>This will allocate 4Gb of RAM to minikube (I'm assuming you have enough host ram to support this) and should give a much more comfortable experience in the next few sections.</p><p>Do ask on the QAÂ page if you have any problems here.</p>
