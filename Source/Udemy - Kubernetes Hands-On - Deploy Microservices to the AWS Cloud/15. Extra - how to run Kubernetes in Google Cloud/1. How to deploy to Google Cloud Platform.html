<p>As you know, the course was designed around AWS, as that is by far the most in-demand cloud platform, and it also happens to be the one IÂ use in my real work. It's the platform I know and trust.</p><p>But I've been asked by a few people if I can show how to run the application on <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>. It was quite a challenge as I've hardly ever used the platform before - so I spent a day working on porting the Fleetman application to GCP. </p><p><strong>But, it turns out to be easy!</strong></p><p>As this isn't a core part of the course, I'm linking here to my YouTube channel a 30 minute video where we follow the same steps on Google Cloud.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9vy3wHGKeo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get access to the video here!</a></p>
