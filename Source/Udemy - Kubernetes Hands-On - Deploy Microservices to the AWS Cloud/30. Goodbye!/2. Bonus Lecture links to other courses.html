<p>Well done completing the course!</p><p>You can find my blog at <a href="http://blog.chesterwood.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog.chesterwood.io/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5fgyj9JaFvTMBUrKRdqYg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My YouTube channel is here. </a></p><p>I'm building up my courses on Udemy over time. Currently I have:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Docker for Java Developers </strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-hands-on/?couponCode=K8SCOMPLETE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.udemy.com/docker-hands-on</a></p><p>It covers Docker but be aware it was specifically designed for Java developers. If that's you and you're new to Docker then you might want to check it out:</p><p>It also covers Docker Swarm (preview: it's not as good as K8S!)</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Spark for Java Developers </strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-for-java-developers/?couponCode=K8SCOMPLETE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">udemy.com/apache-spark-for-java-developers</a></p><p>Most Spark developers are using Scala or Python, but Java is a great language to use with it too. It's also a great way to get some practice with modern Java functional coding style (lambdas)</p></li></ul><p>I'll be producing more courses for Udemy so keep an eye out!</p><p>Good luck with K8S!</p><p>Richard Chesterwood.</p>
