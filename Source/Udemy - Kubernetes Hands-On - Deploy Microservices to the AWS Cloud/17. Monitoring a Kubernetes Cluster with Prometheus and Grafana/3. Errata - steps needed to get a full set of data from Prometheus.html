<p>After I&nbsp;recorded these videos, a problem has been reported that after installing prometheus (coming in the next video), some of the screens of data are blank.</p><p>This isn't a major problem if you're just wanting to try out prometheus, but it is frustrating that you don't see a complete set of data. </p><p>Here is the workaround - it's a simple config change to your kops cluster...</p><p><br></p><p>1: Edit your cluster definition with "kops edit cluster --name ${NAME}"</p><p>2: Find the key called "kubelet:", it will have one entry below it called anonymousAuth: false. You're going to add two further entries so that this section looks like the following:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">kubelet:
  anonymousAuth: false    
  authenticationTokenWebhook: true    
  authorizationMode: Webhook</pre><p><br></p><p>3: Save your changes. Then "kops update cluster --yes".</p><p>4: You will now need to do a "rolling update", which is where kops will kill each node in turn, and bring up a new node with the new configuration. </p><p><code>kops rolling-update cluster --yes </code></p><p>Sometimes this process hangs - not a problem. Just wait five minutes, and if no progress, "control-C", re-run the command again. Keep doing this until the rolling update reports there is nothing to do.</p><p>Now you can proceed with the next videos!</p>
